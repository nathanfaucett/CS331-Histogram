CS331 Histogram


PP 7 Design and implement an application that creates a histogram that allows you to visually inspect the frequency distribution of a set of values. The program should  read in an arbitrary number of integers that are in the range of 1 to 100 inclusive; then produce a chart similar to the one below that indicates how many input values fell in the range 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and so on. Print an asterisk for each value entered.

```bash
01-10     | ****
11-20     | **
21-30     | *****************************************
31-40     |  
41-50     | ***
51-60     | *********
61-70     | **
71-80     | ******
81-90     | *********
91-100    | *************
```
